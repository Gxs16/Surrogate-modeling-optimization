# Surrogate model for calibration

## Intro to surrogate model

Surrogate model usually is a statistal model, which is used to replace the original model during the calibration. Surrogate model is much less expensive than original model during calibration.

## Methodology

The framework of this project followed Chen Wang [1].

Surrogate model is SVR, and ASMO, the sampling algorithm, is also from Chen Wang.

## Outlook

Use a new sample algorithm to make this project work. And combine it with the fluid dymnamic model.

## Problem

The original samples is not enough, the statistical model can not predict the right optima.
